# UI Test Plan

This plan tests SamSquare through its actual console interface. Run the cases in
order. Test Case 1 starts with an empty task list. Cases 2–17 continue in
the same process; Cases 18–39 explicitly restart the process with the saved
state or replacement fixture specified in each case. Stop at the first failure.
Every `bye`, including one surrounded by spaces, must terminate its process
after the response separator.

Run the process in a fresh working directory with no `data/samsquare.txt`, so
saved personal tasks do not affect the starting state. Compile and run using
Java 25, preserving UTF-8 output for the banner.

The greeting appears exactly once before Test Case 1.

Expected greeting:

```text
      __________
    /            \
   /   •     •    \
  |      ᴥ         |
   \    _____     /
    \____________/
      ||    ||
      ||____||
HELLO!! I am SamSquare :D
What can I do for you?
```

After the greeting and every command response, SamSquare prints this separator:

```text
____________________________________________________________
```

The separator is part of the expected output for every case, although it is
shown once here to keep the cases readable. Leading spaces inside output blocks
are significant. Input markers `<one trailing space>` and `<three spaces>`
stand for literal spaces, including when placed before or after a command.
Leading and trailing command spaces are ignored; internal description spaces
are preserved. Padded commands with missing arguments have the same errors as
their unpadded equivalents.

## Test Case 1: List an empty collection

Input: `list`

Expected response:

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
```

The task list remains empty.

## Test Case 2: Reject an empty ToDo without changing state

Input:

```text
todo
list
```

Expected responses:

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! HEY!! The description of a todo cannot be empty!
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
```

The follow-up `list` confirms that the rejected command added nothing.

## Test Case 3: Add all task types

Input:

```text
todo borrow book
deadline return book /by 2019-10-15
event project meeting /from Mon 2pm /to 4pm
list
```

Expected responses:

```text
 Got it!! I've added this task:
   [T][ ] borrow book
 Now you have 1 tasks in the list :)
```

```text
 Got it! I've added this task:
   [D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 Now you have 2 tasks in the list :)
```

```text
 Got it. I've added this task:
   [E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
 Now you have 3 tasks in the list.
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][ ] borrow book
 2.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

This verifies formatted deadline dates and unchanged arbitrary event time strings.

## Test Case 4: Reject malformed Deadline commands without changing state

Input:

```text
deadline submit report
deadline  /by Friday
deadline submit report /by<one trailing space>
list
```

Expected responses:

 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 5: Reject malformed Event commands without changing state

Input:

```text
event team meeting
event team meeting /from Monday
event  /from Monday /to Tuesday
event team meeting /from  /to Tuesday

list
```

Expected responses:

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! An event needs the format: event <task> /from <time> /to <time>.
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! An event needs both a starting and ending time.
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! An event needs the format: event <task> /from <time> /to <time>.
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! Broski.. an event must have a starting time!
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! An event needs both a starting and ending time.
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][ ] borrow book
 2.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 6: Reject invalid mark arguments without changing state

Input:

```text

```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! There is no task numbered 0.
```

 1.[T][ ] borrow book
 2.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 7: Mark the first and last tasks

Input:

```text
mark 1
mark 3
```

Expected responses:

```text
 WELL DONE!! I've marked this task as done:
   [T][X] borrow book
```

```text
 WELL DONE!! I've marked this task as done:
   [E][X] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 8: Reject invalid unmark arguments and preserve state

Input:

```text
unmark
unmark xyz
unmark 0
unmark 4
list
```

Expected responses:

```text

```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! The task number must be a valid number.
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! There is no task numbered 0.
```

```text

```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][X] borrow book
 2.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 3.[E][X] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 9: Unmark the first and last tasks

Input:

```text
unmark 1
unmark 3
```

Expected responses:

```text
 OK, I've marked this task as not done yet:
   [T][ ] borrow book
```

```text

   [E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 10: Reject invalid delete arguments and preserve state

delete 4
list
```

Expected responses:

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! Specify the task number to delete please!

```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! There is no task numbered 0.
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! There is no task numbered -1.
```

```text
 WAIT PAUSE!! There is no task numbered 4.
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][ ] borrow book
 2.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 3.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

## Test Case 11: Remove from the collection and verify reindexing

Input:

```text
delete 2
list
todo buy groceries
delete 1
list
```

Expected responses:

```text
 Ahh noted! I've removed this task:
   [D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)
 Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][ ] borrow book
 2.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
```

```text
 Got it!! I've added this task:
   [T][ ] buy groceries
 Now you have 3 tasks in the list :)
```

```text
 Ahh noted! I've removed this task:
   [T][ ] borrow book
 Now you have 2 tasks in the list.
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[E][ ] project meeting (from: Mon 2pm to: 4pm)
 2.[T][ ] buy groceries
```

This is the collection-specific regression case. It verifies removal from the
middle and front, automatic index shifting, and adding after a removal.

 Now you have 2 tasks in the list :)
```

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:

the file from Test Case 26, unless a fixture below replaces it.
Compare the standard greeting before command input.

Input:

```text
list
mark 2
bye
```

Expected responses:

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)

   [D][X] leap day (by: Feb 29 2024)
```

```text
Byebye hope to see you again soon!
```

## Test Case 28: Reload the completed deadline

Starts a new process in the same isolated working directory, retaining
the file from Test Case 27, unless a fixture below replaces it.
Compare the standard greeting before command input.

Input:

```text
list
bye
```

Expected responses:

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[D][ ] return book (by: Oct 15 2019)

```

## Test Case 29: Handle old or invalid saved dates without losing the original file

Starts a new process in the same isolated working directory, retaining
the file from Test Case 28, unless a fixture below replaces it.
Compare the standard greeting before command input.

Saved file before startup:

```text
T | 0 | before
D | 1 | valid saved date | 2024-02-29
D | 0 | legacy date | Friday
D | 0 | impossible date | 2023-02-29
E | 0 | after | noon | evening
```

Startup notice (after the greeting separator):

```text
Some saved deadlines have invalid dates and were not loaded. Original file will be backed up in data/samsquare-legacy-dates-*.txt before saving.
```

Verify legacy backup after session: exactly one backup must equal the fixture byte for byte.

Input:

```text
list
todo keep
bye
```

Expected responses:

```text
 Here are the tasks in your list:
 1.[T][ ] before
 2.[D][X] valid saved date (by: Feb 29 2024)

## Test Case 37: Match exact due dates in a mixed saved list without saving

Starts a new process after Case 36 with the fixture below. Compare the standard greeting.
The blank line in the fixture must survive: an unintended save would remove it.
The date-looking ToDo and event must not match. Both completed and incomplete
deadlines must match in their original order, with independent result numbering.

Saved file before startup:

```text
T | 0 | note 2024-02-29

D | 0 | before leap | 2024-02-28
D | 1 | first leap | 2024-02-29
E | 0 | date event | 2024-02-29 | 2024-02-29
D | 0 | second leap | 2024-02-29
D | 0 | after leap | 2024-03-01
D | 0 | other year | 2020-02-29
D | 0 | other month | 2024-03-29
```

Verify task file unchanged after session: preserve the entire fixture byte for byte.

Input:

```text
